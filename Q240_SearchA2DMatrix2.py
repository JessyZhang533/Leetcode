#  Starting from Top-Right corner:
# If current grid M[r][c] is smaller than target x, there is no need to consider M[r][ :c] since all the grids on the left must be smaller as well. So, x must be in the rows below and we can safely make r += 1.
# We keep moving M[r][c] downwards until it's larger x, then we can safely move leftwards and make c -= 1 since all the grids in M[ :r][c ] would be larger than x.
# During the search, if x is found, we return True. Otherwise, we can either move downwards or leftwards safely.
# If we reach left-bottom corner without hitting x, then target is not in the matrix.
